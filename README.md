# ufnode
For gaming low lag number crunching in blockchains and sidechains. Executable binary forest data structure where every node has a global (100 times faster than sha256) secureHashed int128 name (TODO fork more secure hash algorithms) of a double, float, 0-8 byte string, 15 bytes of a sha256, pair of those, etc.
